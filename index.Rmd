# **My Lab Journal**

This is a template example for lab journaling. Students in the data science courses at the Institute of Entrepreneurship will use this template to learn R for business analytics. Students can replace this text as they wish.

```{r, eval = TRUE}
numbers <- 1:1000

# This will print the first 10 elements of the vector numbers
numbers[1:30]

# This will plot a histogram of 100 random elements of the vector numbers
hist(sample(numbers, 700, replace = T))
```

# **My guys**
Just testing with my guys
